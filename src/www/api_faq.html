                    This page is an FAQ on how to use Monarch Bot, possible problems and
                    fixes; it will provide help for the 
                    <a href="https://gitlab.com/monarch3/SquireBot/">Squire Bot</a> 
                    integration.

                    <p id="top"></p>
                    <h2 id="SquireBotIntegration">Squire Bot Integration</h2>            
                    This bot is integrated quite closely with Squire Bot, to enable trice
                    bot in your Squire Bot tournament you need to set the tricebot-enabled
                    property to true.
                    <blockquote>!update-properties "Tournament Name" tricebot-enabled=true</blockquote>
                    <br>
                    
                    If you want to use player deck verification then you need to set the
                    player-deck-verification property to true.
                    <blockquote>!update-properties "Tournament Name" player-deck-verification=true</blockquote>
                    <br>
                    
                    The cockatrice-name command will automatically update the data that
                    is sent to the trice bot on game creation. However the deck hashes
                    cannot be updated after a game is started.

                    <h3 id="PlayersBeingKickedWrongly">Players Being Kicked Wrongly</h3>
                    If a player is kicked the name that was sent to the API may be wrong
                    it can be updated via the <a href="/api#apiupdateplayerinfo">../api/updateplayerinfo</a>
                    endpoint.
                    When a player is kicked it will tell you the names it was expecting,
                    which can then be used to find the player name that was typed in wrongly.
                    
                    <h4>With Squire Bot...</h4>
                    With Squire Bot you can use the following commands:
                    
                    As a player you can use the cockatrice-name command, if this fails 
                    use the tricebot-update-player command.
                    The syntax for the cockatrice-name command is:
                    <blockquote>!cockatrice-name New name</blockquote>
                    
                    The syntax for the tricebot-update-player command is:
                    <blockquote>!tricebot-update-player "Tournament Name" "Match Number" "player name/mention"
                    "new player name"</blockquote>
                    For example to change the name "Vldimir" to "Vladimir" in tournament
                    "fnm-3/6", match 5, the command would be:
                    <blockquote>!tricebot-update-player fnm-3/6 5 Vldimir Vladimir</blockquote>
                    
                    <h4>Alternatively You Can Disable Player Deck Verification...</h4>
                    Alternatively you can disable player deck verification with the
                    <a href="/api#apidisableplayerdeckverification">../api/disableplayerdeckverification</a> endpoint.
                    <h4>With Squire Bot...</h4>
                    With Squire Bot you can use the command:
                    <blockquote>!ticebot-disable-pdi "Tournament Name" "Match Number"</blockquote>
                    For example the command to disable player deck verification for
                    match 5 of tournament "fnm-3/6" the command would be:
                    <blockquote>!tricebot-disable-pdi fnm-3/6 5</blockquote>

                    <h3 id="WrongCockatriceVersion">Wrong Cockatrice Version</h3>
                    If you have a cockatrice with version of 2.8.0 or less then the client does not support games made by spectators.
                    <a href="https://github.com/Cockatrice/Cockatrice/releases"> Current Cockatrice version.</a>
                    The version in which support for games with no players was introduced is:
                    <a href="https://github.com/Cockatrice/Cockatrice/releases/tag/2021-05-28-Development-2.8.1-beta.2">2.8.1 beta 2</a>
                    
                    <h3 id="WrongGameFilter">Wrong Game Filter</h3>
                    You should have "Show password protected games" enabled; game type
                    filters should all be un-ticked and; the spectator filters should also
                    all be unticked. If these are your settings then it should show the games.
                    You can use the "Creator Name" filter to find the game far faster,
                    for Squire Bot the creator is called "Monarch Bot".
                    
                    <h2 id="ReplayCannotBeDownloaded">Replay Cannot Be Downloaded</h2>
                    If the replay cannot be downloaded with a file not found message then
                    one of the following is the case:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The game has ended and some players are still in the game or;</li>
                        <li>The server is not responding to replay download requests or;</li>
                        <li>The server has not created a replay</li>
                    </ul>
                    If the game is still in progress then a webpage will appear showing
                    which players are in the game.
                    
                    <h2 id="DownloadAllReplays">Download All Replays For A Tournament</h2>
                    To download all the replays for a Squire Bot tournament the download-replays
                    command can be used, which will return a ZIP file of the replays.
                    <blockquote>!download-replays "Tournament Name"</blockquote>
